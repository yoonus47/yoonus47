# Hi there 👋 I'm Yoonus!

### AI Engineer | Data Scientist | Content Creator

Welcome to my profile. I am a **Master of Artificial Intelligence graduate from RMIT University,** based in Melbourne. I enjoy taking ideas from papers and turning them into working software.

Alot of my current work sits around **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**, **LLM agents**, and deploying ML systems in a way that is practical to maintain.

## 🚀 About Me
- 🎓 **Master of AI** (RMIT University) + **B.Tech in Computer Science**
- 💼 Ex AI Engineer at **Gieom Business Solutions** (built RAG systems for Tier-1 banks)
- 📹 YouTube: **[@Yoonus93](https://youtube.com/@Yoonus93)** where I explain AI concepts simply
- ⚽️ Football fan (still not soccer)
- ♛ Chess piece collector 😁 (around 1200 elo)

## 🔥 Currently Working On

### AI Support Agent (Docs deflection + ticket escalation)
**Repo:** https://github.com/yoonus47/AI_Support_Agent  
**Tech:** Node.js, TypeScript, LangChain, Llama 3.x (70B via Groq), Zod

A lightweight customer support agent that acts like a first line support rep:
- answers from docs first so it does not open tickets unnecessarily
- checks user context (Free vs VIP) before escalating
- raises a ticket only when it makes sense, with priority based on plan and urgency

What I focused on while building it:
- a router style flow where the LLM decides the next step based on an SOP
- tool safety using Zod schemas to catch bad or missing parameters
- kept it simple to run and review, with in-memory chat history
