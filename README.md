# Hi there 👋 I'm Yoonus!

### AI Engineer | Data Scientist | Content Creator

Welcome to my profile! I am a **Master of Artificial Intelligence graduate** and an experienced **AI Engineer** based in Melbourne. My passion lies in bridging the gap between complex research papers and production-grade software.

I specialize in building **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems**, optimizing **LLM workflows**, and deploying scalable **Machine Learning models** to the cloud. When I'm not coding, I create educational content on YouTube to simplify Data Science concepts for the community.

## 🚀 About Me

* 🎓 **Master of AI** from RMIT University & **B.Tech in Computer Science**.
* 💼 **Ex-AI Engineer** at Gieom Business Solutions (Built RAG systems for Tier-1 Banks).
* 📹 **YouTuber** at **[@Yoonus93](https://youtube.com/@Yoonus93)** where I decode AI concepts.
* ⚽️ **Football Fan!** (It's still not soccer!).
* ♛ **Chess Piece Collector 😁** (1200 elo:).
